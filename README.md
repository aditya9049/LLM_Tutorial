ğŸ§  LLM Learning Series

Iâ€™ve started a hands-on journey to understand Large Language Models (LLMs) and Iâ€™m documenting it day by day.
.

ğŸ“… Day 1 â€“ Introduction to LLMs

ğŸ”¹ Explored the basics of LLMs â€“ what they are and why they matter.
ğŸ”¹ Learned how to load a pre-trained LLM (microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct) using Hugging Face Transformers.
ğŸ”¹ Wrote my first prompt and generated text responses.
ğŸ”¹ Understood pipelines (text-generation) and how inference works.
ğŸ”¹ Hands-on Notebook ğŸ‘‰ LLM_01.ipynb

ğŸ“… Day 2 â€“ Tokens and Embeddings

ğŸ”¹ Learned how text is broken into tokens before being processed by LLMs.
ğŸ”¹ Explored how embeddings represent words as high-dimensional vectors capturing meaning and context.
ğŸ”¹ Visualized how the model processes text step by step.
ğŸ”¹ Understood why embeddings are the foundation of everything an LLM can do.
ğŸ”¹ Hands-on Notebook ğŸ‘‰ LLM_2.ipynb

âœ¨ Stay tuned for more daily updates as I continue my LLM learning journey!
